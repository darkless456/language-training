Hi, Anita. This is Giray.

I’m sorry but **I'm busy** next Monday evening,
so I can’t meet you personally at the airport.

When your flight **arrives**, a driver will meet you.

Let’s **plan to meet** in your hotel reception on Tuesday morning at around eight thirty
because **we're meeting** the first client at nine thirty instead of eleven.

By the way, do you **intend to check out** in the morning or **are you staying** another night in Ankara?

I’m afraid **I'm not free** in the evening,
but I can book you an excellent restaurant near the hotel for dinner **if you're staying**
**It opens** around eight, I think.

Anyway, let me know your plans.
```
